# Phase 1 MVP: Global + Local Views

## Core Philosophy
**Phase 1 Goal:** Perfect the "understanding" layer
**V3.0 Goal:** Add the "action" layer on top

User mental model:
1. **Explore** (Global View) → "What matters?"
2. **Understand** (Local View) → "How does it work?"
3. **Act** (Simulation - V3.0) → "What should I change?"

---

## Implementation Phases (Ordered by Ease + Foundation)

### Tier 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days each)
**Goal:** Immediate UX improvements, performance foundation

#### 1.1 Loading Screen ✅
- [x] Show spinner + "Loading 2,583 nodes..."
- [x] Avoid blank screen on initial load
- [ ] Progress bar for data fetch (deferred - requires streaming)

#### 1.2 Reset View Button ✅
- [x] Always visible (top-right corner)
- [x] Returns to initial zoom/pan (all outcomes visible, none expanded)
- [x] Keyboard shortcut: `R` or `Home`

#### 1.3 Basic Rotation on First Expand ~~SKIPPED~~
- ~~Not needed - smart sector filling already prioritizes right-side placement~~

#### 1.4 Performance Foundations ✅
- [x] Debounced zoom/pan → **Replaced with CSS-based visibility (zero JS overhead)**
- [x] FPS counter (dev mode only, color-coded: green ≥50, yellow ≥30, red <30)
- [x] Ring 5 labels removed (1,763 text elements eliminated - too small to read)
- [x] CSS zoom classes control label visibility per ring (single DOM write vs 7000+ ops)

---

### Tier 2: Core Polish (2-3 days each)
**Goal:** Make Global View feel alive and responsive

#### 2.1 Smooth Expand/Collapse Animations ✅
- [x] Nodes animate from parent position with scale 0→1 and opacity 0→1
- [x] Duration: 300ms ease-out (cubic)
- [x] Edges animate from source to target position
- [x] Labels fade in with 150ms delay after nodes
- [ ] ~~Rings shift smoothly~~ (deferred - adds complexity)

#### 2.2 Hover States ~~SKIPPED~~
- ~~Already have node expand on hover - sufficient for now~~

#### 2.3 Visual Feedback (Partial) ✅
- [x] Collapsing: nodes shrink to r=0 with opacity fade (200ms)
- [x] Edges retract back to source on collapse
- [x] Labels fade out on collapse
- [ ] ~~Click flash, spinner~~ (deferred - not critical)

#### 2.4 Auto-Zoom on Expand ✅
- [x] When user expands: smoothly zoom + pan to frame entire branch (Ring 1 → leaves)
- [x] Frames QoL center + entire subtree from Ring 1 ancestor
- [x] Zooms out if needed to fit all nodes (10% padding)
- [x] Duration: 400ms ease-out (cubic)
- [x] On collapse: centers between root and collapsed node
- [x] No camera change when expanding root (Ring 0)

#### 2.5 Rich Tooltips (Partial) ✅
- [x] Node tooltip: name, domain, subdomain, importance, rank, connections, children, driver/outcome status
- [x] Stats grid layout (2-column)
- [x] No delay (instant), fixed bottom-center position
- [ ] ~~Edge tooltip~~ (deferred - need causal edges first)
- [ ] ~~Smart positioning~~ (deferred - fixed position works well)

#### 2.6 Text-Aware Spacing & Visibility ✅
- [x] Visual footprint = max(node diameter, text extent) for spacing calculations
- [x] Text boost system: small text (< 3px) boosted to 3-5px during single-branch exploration
- [x] Boost factor scales: 1 branch = full boost, 5+ branches = no boost
- [x] Ring-specific text orientation: horizontal (Ring 0-1), radial (Ring 2-5)
- [x] Dynamic zoom visibility: labels visible when effectiveSize >= 3px
- [x] JS controls all label opacity (CSS rules removed to prevent conflicts)
- [x] Smart label wrapping: tries 1 line → 2 lines → 3 lines based on available space
- [x] Ring 0-1 constant: importance-based sizing, bold, no boost, no wrapping
- [x] Edge crossing fix: children constrained within parent's angular boundary

---

### Tier 3: Major Features (1 week each)
**Goal:** Complete navigation and causal visualization

#### 3.1 Search & Navigation ✅
- [x] Autocomplete search bar (fuzzy match with Fuse.js)
- [x] Top 5 matches as you type
- [x] Jump behavior: expand path to node, zoom to frame it
- [x] Search by domain filter dropdown
- [x] Recent searches history (last 5, auto-hides after 5 seconds)
- [x] Path highlight glow: searched node + ancestors up to Ring 1 get proportional glow effect
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts: `/` or `Ctrl+K` to focus, `Escape` to close

#### 3.2 Production Performance ✅
- [x] Conditional debug logging system (src/utils/debug.ts)
- [x] Zero console.log overhead in production (tree-shaken by Vite)
- [x] 43 debug statements converted to conditional loggers
- [x] Memoized nodesByRing map (avoids recreation per render)
- [x] Ring circles use D3 data join pattern (no remove/recreate)
- [x] Bundle size: 311 KB (99 KB gzipped)

- [ ] URL sync (?view=local&node=NODE_ID) - deferred

#### 4.6 Smooth Animations ✅

- [x] Node exit: scale 1→0, opacity 1→0, to parent position (200ms easeCubicIn)
- [x] Edge entry: extend from source with opacity fade (200ms, delayed 200ms to avoid backward pointing)
- [x] Edge exit: retract with opacity fade (200ms)
- [x] Text labels: fade in after nodes settle (150ms, 300ms delay)
- [x] Position updates: smooth transition on layout changes (300ms)
- [x] Viewport pan/zoom: auto-fit after expand/collapse (400ms easeCubicOut)
- [x] Reset (R key): collapses all expansions and fits viewport
- [x] Node dimension changes: smooth size animation when beta visuals appear/disappear

#### 4.7 Split View Layout ✅
- [x] Horizontal mode: Bezier curves with arrow markers
- [x] Vertical mode: Orthogonal paths (90-degree turns) with no arrows
- [x] Edge thickness indicates beta magnitude in both modes
- [x] Auto-switches based on container aspect ratio
- [x] Tree-based layout: subtree width/height calculations prevent overlaps
- [x] Parent-centered children: 1 child directly under, 2 split evenly, odd centers middle
- [x] Multi-row wrapping: max 4 nodes per row, excess wraps to new rows
- [x] Vertical compactness: tighter spacing (15px), smaller row gaps (12-30px)
- [x] Aggressive decluttering: hide beta values for depth >1 in vertical mode
- [x] Glow effects: targets and depth 1 nodes only (octagon-shaped for outputs)
